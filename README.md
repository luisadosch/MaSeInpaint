# Project: AI Inpainting - Generative Models vs. Traditional Methods

#### üìù Description  
Developed a study to explore how modern generative AI transforms image inpainting compared to classic techniques. By benchmarking **LaMa** and **Stable Diffusion** against the traditional **Telea** method, the research reveals striking improvements in both performance and visual quality.

#### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Stable Diffusion  
- LaMa  
- OpenCV  
- Pandas  

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges  
- Image preparation  
- Mask improvement  
- Model evaluation  
- Bootstrapping  
- Significance testing  

#### ü§ñ Models Used  
- **LaMa**  
- **Stable Diffusion** (Hugging Face)  
- **Telea** (OpenCV)  

#### üìä Key Findings  
- **Superior Performance:** AI-based models (LaMa & Stable Diffusion) outperform Telea by approximately 14%.  
- **Mask Size is Critical:** The size of the missing area is the most influential factor affecting inpainting quality.  
- **Model Suitability:**  
  - **Stable Diffusion** excels with large masks, though it may sometimes generate "hallucinations."  
  - **LaMa** is optimal for small-to-medium masks, but struggles with larger missing areas.  
- **Future Directions:** Enhancing model efficiency and reducing unwanted object generation will further improve inpainting quality.

#### ‚ùì What is Image Inpainting?  
- **Definition:** Restoring missing, damaged, or removed parts of an image.  
- **Applications:** Restoration, enhancement, and object removal.
