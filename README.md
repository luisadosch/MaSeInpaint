# AI Inpainting: Generative Models vs. Traditional Methods

This study dives into how modern generative AI transforms image inpainting compared to classic techniques. By benchmarking **LaMa** and **Stable Diffusion** against the conventional **Telea** method, the research reveals striking improvements in both performance and visual quality.

## Key Highlights

- **Enhanced Performance:**  
  - **LaMa:** Delivers a **14.64%** improvement in FID scores, maintaining strong structural coherenceâ€”ideal for small to medium missing areas.  
  - **Stable Diffusion:** Achieves a **13.40%** improvement by generating realistic textures, especially effective in filling large gaps.

- **Method Breakdown:**  
  - **Telea Inpainting:** A fast, traditional approach that propagates pixel information from the image border using local averages.  
  - **LaMa:** Combines standard and Fourier convolutions to grasp global image context, leading to coherent inpainting even with significant missing regions.  
  - **Stable Diffusion:** Works in a latent space with a U-Net architecture and optional text prompts, enabling creative and context-aware reconstructions.

- **Evaluation Strategy:**  
  Performance was rigorously assessed using the **Frechet Inception Distance (FID)** metric, supported by bootstrapping and robust statistical tests to ensure the results are significant.

## Why It Matters

The study underscores the leap generative AI makes over classical methods:
- **Realism:** AI-based models produce inpainted images that closely resemble the original content.
- **Flexibility:** Different models shine depending on the size of the missing area, offering tailored solutions for varied inpainting challenges.
- **Innovation:** These advancements pave the way for more accurate and visually appealing image restoration, impacting fields from digital art to advanced photo editing.
